Modular rectangular LED construction kit. Simple pcb frames allow blocks of 8 leds to be easily powered by a 7.4V source such as a 2-cell Lithium polymer battery.

#Parts List

Each panel (7 boards) requires 56 LEDs, and 14 resistors.
*	LEDs Rectangular, 5 x 2 x 7mm:
	-	Red - [Digi-Key 754-1201-ND](http://www.digikey.co.uk/product-detail/en/WP113IDT/754-1201-ND/1747600)
	-	Green - [Digi-Key 754-1200-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/WP113GDT/754-1200-ND/1747599)
	-	Yellow - [Digi-Key 754-1203-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/WP113YDT/754-1203-ND/1747602)
*	130Ω 3mm Resistors - [Digi-Key S130QCT-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/CFM14JT130R/S130QCT-ND/2617670)
*	You will need a 7.4V power source, such as a 2-cell lipo battery and a charger.

	-	[HobbyKing B3AC Compact Charger](http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__22410__HobbyKing_B3AC_Compact_Charger.html)
*	Hook up wire.  A bundle of short, tinned multicore wires would be ideal [such as these](http://www.dhgate.com/product/enameled-wire-23mm-1mm-black-short-wire-welding/143403910.html), but i made my own.  Short jumper wires could work but may be too stiff.
*	For assembling the boards together, wire wrap works well, otherwise small zip ties can work.  String would probably work well.

**Take Note!**
The boards will get a little bit warm when on.  Take this into consideration when arranging the boards so as to avoid putting too much current through a single board.
